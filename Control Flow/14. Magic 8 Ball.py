elif random_number == 2:

elif random_number == 3:

elif random_number == 4:
  answer = 'Reply hazy, try again'
elif random_number == 5:
  answer = 'Ask again later'
elif random_number == 6:
  answer = 'Better not tell you now'
elif random_number == 7:
  answer = 'My sources say no'
elif random_number == 8:
  answer = 'Outlook not so good'
elif random_number == 9:
  answer = 'Very doubtful'
else:
  answer = 'Error'
  
print('Magic 8 Ball:  ' + answer)
