The year is 2199... we have become an interplanetary species and can travel to other planets in the solar system! ðŸš€

Create a weight conversion program that:

Asks the user what their Earth weight is (as a float).
Asks the user for a planet number (as an int).
Then, use an if/elif/else statement to calculate the user's weight on the destination planet.

To calculate the user's weight:

destination weight=Earth weight * relative gravity

Number	Planet	    Relative Gravity
1	    Mercury	    0.38
2	    Venus	    0.91
3	    Mars	    0.38
4	    Jupiter	    2.53
5	    Saturn	    1.07
6	    Uranus	    0.89
7	    Neptune	    1.14

If the user enters a planet number outside of 1 - 7, print a message that says 'Invalid planet number'.
