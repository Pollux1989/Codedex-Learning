""" 
Snapple is a famous tea drink brand from Queens, New York. Each bottle cap comes with a silly fun fact.

Use the random module to create a number from 0 to 5.

Then use an if/elif/else statement to print out one of these six random Snapple facts:

0 - 'Flamingos turn pink from eating shrimp.'
1 - 'The only food that doesn't spoil is honey.'
2 - 'Shrimp can only swim backwards.'
3 - 'A taste bud's life span is about 10 days.'
4 - 'It is impossible to sneeze while sleeping.'
5 - 'It is illegal to sing off-key in North Carolina.'
