# Functions
As our code gets longer and longer, you might find yourself copying and pasting a particular code block in different parts of the program. That's no good!

‚ÄúDon't Repeat Yourself‚Äù (DRY) is a principle in software development aimed at reducing repetition and writing good clean code. Functions play a big part.

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. To execute this block of code, you just need to know the function's name, followed by a pair of parenthesis ().

Whether the task is five or twenty lines of code, you can throw it in a function and use it later anywhere in your program. It takes a little more effort initially but will save you a lot of time in the long term.

Plot twist! In this course, we have been using functions all along. üß©

Built-in functions are 68 functions that come with the Python interpreter available for use. Here are some that you might recognize:

print()
input()
len()
We've used them before, but didn't get into how they work behind the scenes.

And that's okay! This is the beautiful part about built-in functions. Like a car, you don't need to know what's underneath the hood to operate it.

Let's look at some built-in Python functions!'''

# Define a Function
So how do we create a function from scratch?

User-defined functions are functions we define ourselves to do a specific task, and it's a two-step process: 1Ô∏è) define and 2Ô∏è) call.

To define a function, we need a function definition. A function definition begins with the def keyword, followed by the function name, a set of parentheses, and a colon in that order.

Here‚Äôs what a function definition looks like:
