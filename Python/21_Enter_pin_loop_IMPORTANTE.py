Let's make it so that it's the same guessing game, but there is a new limit to the number of tries (it was infinite before).

First, introduce a variable called tries at the top and give it a value of 0.

Then, add the tries variable to the while loop using a relational operator (like you did with guess).

Suppose you got detention and the teacher wants you to write "I will not use Snapchat in class" on the whiteboard 100 times.

Create a detention.py program that does this using code.

(This is where we begin to see the true power of computing. What takes humans hours can take a computer microseconds. ðŸ¤¯)
